## Artificial Intelligence.

In this space we will address issues related to Artificial Intelligence, in the book Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach, written by Staiart Russell and Peter Norving divides the concepts into four possible areas such as: Systems that think like humans, Systems that think rationally, systems that acts like humans, systems that act rationally.[1]

<summary> Occurence Probability</summary>

<p>The approach to data analysis is based on the mean of the distribution represented by the next equation, which is the standard form of the Gaussian distribution [2]. 
  
    \begin{equation}  
P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma ^2}}
\end{equation}    

[comment]: <>(P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi  \sigma ^2} e^{\frac{(x- \mu)^2}{2 \sigma ^2}})    
    
Where P(x) is the probability of occurrence of the variable n, $\sigma$ is the Standard deviation, $\sigma$ 2 is the Variance, $\mu$ is the Mean. The method is based on the postulate that the values of the unknown parameters are those that produce a maximum probability of observing the measured data. Assuming
that the measurements are independent of each other [2].

<summary> Linear Regression</summary>

<p>
The simple linear regression model, is a model with a single regressor x that has a relationship with a response y that is a straight line, we can found this
equations in the book Introduction to linear regression Analysis [3].

    \begin{equation}  
\hat{y_0} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x_0
\end{equation}    
 
where the intercept $\beta_0$ and the slope $\beta_1$ are unknown constants.
